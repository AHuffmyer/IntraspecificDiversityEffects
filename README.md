"larval_settle.csv": Larval settlement at ambient and high temperature.  
"larval_surv.csv": Larval survivorship at ambient and high temperature.  

*Juveniles*  

"Juvenile_ApexTemps.csv": Temperature data from ambient and high temperature treatments.  
"Juvenile_Responses.csv": Juvenile coral survival and growth (polyp expansion) at ambient and high temperature treatments.  

*Adults*  

"PAM.csv": Sample ID information for adult photosynthetic efficiency metrics.  
"T1_61019.pam" through "T6_70119.pam": Photosynthetic efficiency measurements of adult corals as output from PAM instrument.  
"Adults_Light_Temp.csv": Light and temperature data from ambient and high temperature treatments.  
"Adults_Growth.csv": Adult growth measured by buoyant weight at ambient and high temperature treatments.  
"Adults_Survivorship.csv": Adult coral survivorship at ambient and high temperature treatments.  

*Genotyping*
